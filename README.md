# Predicting Consumer Tastes with Big Data at Gap

## Overview

This project leverages big data to address the challenges faced by Gap Inc., such as declining sales, increased competition from fast fashion brands, and shifts in consumer spending habits. Through detailed analysis of reviews, SEO, stock performance, and sentiment, we aim to derive actionable insights that can help reorient Gap's strategy towards a more data-driven approach.
